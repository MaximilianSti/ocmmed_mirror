cluster_files: cluster_files/
# path where various files from the cluster will be saved

batch_num: 10
# number of parallel batches

batch_rxn_sols: 10
# number of reaction-enum solutions per batch

batch_div_sols: 10
# number of diversity-enum solutions per batch

approach: grouped
# which parallelization approach to use on the slurm cluster
# either 'grouped' or 'separate'
# if 'grouped': within each batch, several reaction-enum and div-enum solutions will be computed,
#               the solutions will be concatenated at the end
# if 'separate': reaction-enum solutions will be computed first, then concatenated, and div-enum solutions
#                will be computed separately

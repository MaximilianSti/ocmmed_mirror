cluster_files: cluster_files/
# path where various files will be saved for the cluster computation
# recommendation: use 2 different registries for cluster_files and output_path

batch_num: 10
# number of parallel batches for each condition
batch_rxn_sols: 100
# number of reaction-enum solutions per batch
batch_div_sols: 100
# number of diversity-enum solutions per batch

approach: separate
# which parallelization approach to use on the slurm cluster
# either 'grouped' or 'separate'
# if 'grouped': within each batch, several reaction-enum and div-enum solutions will be computed,
#               the solutions will be concatenated at the end
# if 'separate': reaction-enum solutions will be computed first, then concatenated, and div-enum solutions
#                will be computed separately

emails: true
# if true, you will receive an email alert everytime a batch starts and ends
# if false, you will only receive no email alerts
cores: 24
# number of cores to assign for each job
memory: 64
# allocated memory per job in gigabytes
time: 10:00:00
# maximum allowed runtime per job in hours:minutes:seconds
pythonpath: system/Python-3.7.4
# path where the python module is located on the cluster
envpath: env
# path where the python virtual environment is located (by default: in the same registry as this file, in a folder called "env")
cplexpath: /home/mstingl/save/CPLEX_Studio1210/cplex/python/3.7/x86-64_linux

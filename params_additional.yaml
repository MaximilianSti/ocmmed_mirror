### This file contains parameters which can be modified if needed
# parameters with the tag OPTIONAL can be left empty if the file is not present

model_params:
  solver: cplex
  # must be a solver supported by cobrapy (currently: either cplex, glpk or gurobi), and must be correctly installed
  # see instructions for cplex installation in the dexom_python documentation
  timelimit: 600
  # solver timelimit for each optimization step (in seconds). Leave empty for no timelimit
  feasibility: 1e-7
  # solver feasibility tolerance. Affects the speed of the solver
  mipgaptol: 1e-3
  # solver MIP gap tolerance. Affects the speed of the solver
  verbosity: 1
  # solver verbosity (1 for no solver output, 2 for warnings, 3 for full solver output)

imat_params:
  epsilon: 1e-4
  # minimum flux value for reactions associated with highly expressed genes
  threshold: 1e-4
  # threshold for determining whether a reaction is active or inactive (must be greater than solver feasibility)

enum_params:
  objective_tolerance: 1e-3
  # tolerance for the objective function when searching for equally optimal solutions during the enumeration
  # if you are using discrete weights instead of qualitative weights, increase this parameter up to 1e-2 for faster runtimes

rxn_enum_params:
  reaction_list: pilot_data/HumanGEM11_reactions_shuffled.csv
  # OPTIONAL
  # providing a shuffled list of reactions can reduce possible bias in the reaction-enumeration method
  # if left empty, the reactions will be used in the order in which they are in the network

div_enum_params:
  dist_anneal: 0.9
  # parameter for controlling the distance between each successive diversity-enum solution
  # This parameter is ignored in the cluster pipeline, as it will be calculated based on the number of batches and iterations
  icut: true
  # if true, will apply integer-cut constraints. This will prevent diversity-enum from finding duplicate solutions
  full: false
  # if true, will use the full-DEXOM implementation (see dexom-python documentation).
  # This very significantly increases the computation time per iteration and should only be done on small models

blocked_rxns: pilot_data/human-gem11_blocked.txt
# OPTIONAL
# provide a list of reactions which are blocked in the model.
# This will be used for determining which reactions are inactive in the cell-specific model

### This file contains parameters which can be modified if needed

model_params:
  solver: cplex
  # must be a solver supported by cobrapy (currently: either cplex, glpk or gurobi), and must be correctly installed
  # see instructions for cplex installation in the dexom_python documentation
  timelimit: 600
  # solver timelimit for each optimization step (in seconds). Leave empty for no timelimit
  feasibility: 1e-6
  # solver feasibility tolerance. Affects the speed of the solver
  mipgaptol: 1e-3
  # solver MIP gap tolerance. Affects the speed of the solver
  verbosity: 1
  # solver verbosity (1 for no solver output, 2 to display warnings, 3 for full solver output)

imat_params:
  epsilon: 1e-2
  # minimum flux value for reactions associated with highly expressed genes
  threshold: 1e-5
  # threshold for determining whether a reaction is active or inactive (must be greater than solver feasibility)

enum_params:
  objective_tolerance: 1e-3

rxn_enum_params:
  reaction_list: # pilot_data/HumanGEM11_reactions_shuffled.csv
  # if left empty, will use the reactions in the order in which they are in the network

div_enum_params:
  dist_anneal: 0.9
  # parameter for controlling the distance between each successive diversity-enum solution
  icut: true
  # if true, will apply integer-cut constraints. This will prevent diversity-enum from finding duplicate solutions
  full: false
  # if true, will use the full-DEXOM implementation (see dexom_python documentation).
  # This significantly increases the runtime
